Of course, I'd be happy to help you create a portfolio website using GitHub and Visual Studio Code! Follow these steps to set up your portfolio website:

**1. Create a New GitHub Repository:**
- Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and log in to your account.
- Click the "+" button in the top right corner and choose "New Repository."
- Give your repository a name. For a portfolio website, you might name it something like "portfolio" or "my-portfolio."
- Optionally, you can add a description, choose public or private visibility, and select a license if desired.
- Click the "Create repository" button.

**2. Clone Your Repository to Your Local Machine:**
- Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- From the main menu, select "View" > "Command Palette" or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
- Type "Git: Clone" and paste the URL of the repository you created on GitHub.
- Choose a location on your local machine where you want to clone the repository.
- After cloning, VS Code will ask if you want to open the repository. Click "Open."

**3. Create Your Portfolio Website:**
- Inside your cloned repository in VS Code, create a new file named `index.html`. This will be the main page of your portfolio.
- Start building your portfolio website by adding HTML and CSS code to `index.html`. You can use frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS libraries to style your website.
- As you make changes, save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`), and you'll see the changes reflected in the preview window.

**4. Commit and Push Your Changes:**
- Once you're satisfied with your changes, go back to VS Code.
- In the Source Control view (usually the leftmost icon on the sidebar), you'll see your changes listed.
- Enter a commit message describing your changes in the input box at the top and click the checkmark icon to commit.
- After committing, click the three dots icon (...) and choose "Push" to push your changes to your GitHub repository.

**5. Set Up GitHub Pages:**
- On your GitHub repository page, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Choose the branch you want to deploy. For a basic setup, choose the "main" branch.
- Select the root folder as the source for GitHub Pages.
- Click "Save" or "Save Changes."

**6. Access Your Portfolio Website:**
- After a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your portfolio website is hosted using GitHub Pages. This URL will be in the format: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL to view your portfolio website.

Remember that this is just a basic guide to get you started. You can customize and expand your portfolio website further by adding more pages, projects, and styling. Good luck!
