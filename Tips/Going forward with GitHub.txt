Certainly, here's a step-by-step guide on how to continue making changes to your GitHub-hosted portfolio website:

1. **Pull Latest Changes (Optional):**
   - Before you start making new changes, it's a good practice to pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository to your local machine, in case others have contributed or you've made changes from another location.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
   - Run:
     ```
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Make the desired changes to your HTML, CSS, or any other files.
   - Save the changes.

3. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Open the Source Control view in Visual Studio Code (usually the source control icon on the left sidebar).
   - You'll see the changed files listed.
   - Enter a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you've made.
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit your changes.

4. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - After committing, click the three dots icon (...) in the Source Control view.
   - Choose "Push" to send your committed changes to your GitHub repository.

5. **Verify on GitHub:**
   - Open your GitHub repository's page in your web browser.
   - You should see your new commits listed under the "Commits" tab.

6. **GitHub Pages (Optional):**
   - If you're using GitHub Pages to host your website, your changes should be automatically reflected on your live site once you push to GitHub.

That's it! You can repeat steps 2-6 whenever you want to make further changes to your website. This process allows you to keep your local development environment synchronized with your GitHub repository and your live website (if you're using GitHub Pages).

Remember to commit your changes regularly, provide clear commit messages, and occasionally pull from the repository to stay up to date with any changes made by others. This workflow ensures that your code is versioned, collaborative, and available for viewing online.
