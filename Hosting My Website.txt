Yes, it is possible to host your website without paying for anything using GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   - Make sure your portfolio website code is pushed to a GitHub repository. If you've been following the previous steps, your code should already be in a repository.

2. **GitHub Pages Setup:**
   - In your GitHub repository, click on the "Settings" tab.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," choose the branch you want to deploy. This is usually the "main" branch.
   - Click "Save."
   - After a moment, you'll see a notification indicating that your site is published.

3. **Access Your Website:**
   - Once your site is published, you'll find the URL where your website is hosted. It will be in the format: `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`.

4. **Update and Redeploy:**
   - Whenever you make changes to your website's code and want to update your hosted site, simply follow the steps to commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
   - GitHub Pages will automatically detect the changes and update your live site.

GitHub Pages is an excellent choice for hosting simple static websites, such as portfolio websites. It's user-friendly, free, and integrates directly with your GitHub repository, making it easy to manage and update your site's content.

Remember that GitHub Pages is designed for static websites, which means it supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets. If you need server-side processing or dynamic content, you might need to explore other hosting options.
